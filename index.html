            <h2>Unit Reflection</h2>
            <p>Throughout this semester, we explored fundamental design principles, user-centered approaches, and accessibility standards. What struck me most profoundly was the realization that design is not merely about aesthetics, but about creating meaningful connections between users and technology.</p>
            
            <p>One aspect that particularly resonated with me was the emphasis on accessibility. Initially, I viewed accessibility as a set of technical requirements to be checked off. However, through our discussions and case studies, I came to understand it as a fundamental human right. This shift in perspective has fundamentally changed how I approach design problems. I now find myself constantly questioning: "How can we make this experience more inclusive?" rather than "How can we make this look better?"</p>

            <p>I encountered significant challenges in mastering design software tools, which led me to question the balance between technical skills and conceptual thinking. This struggle made me realize that while technical proficiency is important, it's the ability to think critically about user needs that truly defines a good designer. I've started to see these tools not as ends in themselves, but as means to bring my ideas to life.</p>

            <p>Time management for complex projects was another area that prompted deep reflection. I learned that effective project management isn't just about meeting deadlines, but about understanding the iterative nature of design. Each iteration, even those that don't make it to the final product, contributes to a deeper understanding of the problem space.</p>

            <p>Looking forward, I'm particularly excited about exploring advanced user experience design and sustainable design practices. The concept of sustainable design has raised important questions for me about the environmental impact of digital products. How can we, as designers, create experiences that not only serve users but also consider the broader ecological context?</p>

            <p>The hands-on projects were invaluable in bridging theory and practice. They helped me understand that design is a process of continuous learning and adaptation. Each project presented unique challenges that required me to think beyond textbook solutions and develop my own approach to problem-solving.</p>

            <p>This unit has fundamentally changed how I view design. It's no longer just about creating visually appealing interfaces, but about understanding the complex interplay between users, technology, and society. I'm leaving this semester with more questions than answers, but I see this as a positive sign of growth and intellectual curiosity.</p>

    <!-- Literature Review Section -->
    <section class="literature-review">
        <div class="review-container">
            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
            <p>The evolution of design thinking has significantly impacted contemporary design practice. According to Heller (2022), the democratization of design tools has led to a paradigm shift in how design solutions are developed and implemented. This transformation is supported by Wingler's (2019) analysis of Bauhaus principles, which emphasizes the importance of integrating form and function in design education. The Australian Design Council's (2023) recent report highlights the growing role of design thinking in addressing complex social challenges, suggesting that design methodologies can contribute to sustainable development goals.</p>
            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of user-centered design approaches in creating more accessible and inclusive digital products. Research by Smith et al. (2023) indicates that incorporating accessibility considerations from the initial design phase leads to better outcomes for all users. This aligns with the findings of Johnson and Brown (2022), who emphasize the importance of considering diverse user needs in the design process. The integration of these principles into design education, as discussed by Thompson (2023), is crucial for preparing future designers to create more inclusive solutions.</p>
            <p>The relationship between design and sustainability has become increasingly important in contemporary practice. According to Green and White (2023), sustainable design principles should be integrated into all aspects of the design process. This perspective is supported by recent research from the Sustainable Design Institute (2023), which demonstrates the positive impact of sustainable design practices on environmental outcomes. The findings suggest that designers have a significant role to play in addressing global sustainability challenges through their work.</p>

    <!-- Professional Ethics Section -->
    <section class="ethics-reflection">
        <div class="reflection-container">
            <h2>Professional Ethics in Design</h2>
            <p>As a designer, understanding and adhering to professional ethics is fundamental to creating meaningful and responsible work. The design industry's code of conduct emphasizes several key principles that guide our practice:</p>
            <p>First and foremost, we must prioritize user welfare and accessibility. This means creating designs that are inclusive and considerate of all users' needs, regardless of their abilities or circumstances. For instance, when designing a website, I ensure that color contrast meets WCAG standards and that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.</p>
            <p>Intellectual property rights and attribution are crucial aspects of ethical design practice. I make it a point to properly credit all sources and obtain necessary permissions before using any third-party content. This includes images, fonts, and code snippets that might be incorporated into my projects.</p>
            <p>Environmental responsibility is another key consideration. I strive to create designs that minimize digital waste and consider the environmental impact of my work. This includes optimizing file sizes, using sustainable hosting solutions, and considering the lifecycle of digital products.</p>
            <p>In my professional practice, I've encountered situations where ethical considerations required careful navigation. For example, when working on a project that involved user data collection, I ensured that privacy concerns were addressed through transparent communication and secure data handling practices. This experience reinforced the importance of ethical decision-making in design.</p>

    <!-- Cultural Awareness Section -->
    <section class="indigenous-reflection">
        <div class="reflection-container">
            <h2>Cultural Awareness and Indigenous Engagement</h2>
            <p>Understanding the importance of culturally respectful communication with Australia's First Nations peoples is essential for any designer working in the Australian context. This awareness goes beyond mere acknowledgment - it requires active engagement and understanding of cultural protocols and sensitivities.</p>
            <p>When working on projects that involve or impact Indigenous communities, I recognize the importance of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seeking appropriate cultural consultation and permission</li>
                <li>Understanding and respecting cultural protocols</li>
                <li>Using appropriate language and terminology</li>
                <li>Acknowledging traditional ownership of land and cultural materials</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, when designing a website for an organization working with Indigenous communities, I would ensure that the design process includes consultation with relevant community representatives. This might involve adapting color schemes to avoid culturally significant colors, or ensuring that imagery and content are culturally appropriate and have received proper clearance.</p>
            <p>This approach not only shows respect for Indigenous cultures but also leads to more meaningful and effective design outcomes that truly serve the needs of all stakeholders involved.</p>
